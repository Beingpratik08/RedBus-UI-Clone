# RedBus UI Clone

This is a **static clone** of the RedBus user interface, a popular bus ticket booking platform. The goal of this project is to replicate the look and feel of the RedBus homepage and key UI components using only **HTML** and **CSS**. This clone is created for educational purposes to practice web design and front-end development skills.

## Overview

This project replicates the visual design of the RedBus user interface as a **static webpage**. While the clone does not include dynamic functionalities (such as bus booking or user authentication), it focuses on:

- The layout and structure of the RedBus homepage
- The bus search feature (non-functional, static input fields)
- Basic page elements like navigation, footer, and header

---

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The design is fully responsive and adapts to both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Static Bus Search**: Includes static input fields for searching buses between different cities (no actual search functionality).
- **Header & Footer**: A navigation bar with links and a footer with basic contact and social media links.
- **Bus Listing Section**: A static section that simulates the bus listing page.
- **UI Components**: Buttons, dropdown menus, forms, and other typical UI elements, styled to match the RedBus website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the page and its content.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the UI elements, layout, and responsive design.

This project does not use JavaScript or any dynamic featuresâ€”it is purely a **static HTML/CSS clone**.

## Usage

This is a static clone, so there is no dynamic functionality. You can use the project to:

- Explore the HTML and CSS structure of the RedBus UI.
- Study how the layout adapts to different screen sizes (responsive design).
- View and interact with the static elements (e.g., the bus search input fields, which are non-functional).
  
There are no interactive features like real-time search, user login, or bus booking.
